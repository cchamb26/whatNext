1. Build out simple front end
    - Food logging interface, food calendar, chat menu for reccomendation
2. Connect cheap llm off azure, likely PHI 4 
    - Low token cost, just needs to suggest a proper food based on time
    - Could potentially build without any LLM, just make a algo
3. Connect database to store food entries
    - Food calendar, as well as data for the LLM to synthesize data
4. Bug testing and final patches
